- Value:
Liskov's notion of a behavioural subtype defines a notion of substitutability for objects;
that is, if S is a subtype of T,
then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program

objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
